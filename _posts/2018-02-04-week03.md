Wikipedia Contributions
-----------------------

**Wikipedia account:** Ravenclaw14  
**Contribution page:** <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Ravenclaw14>

After creating my account, my first idea was to go to the Indonesian Wikipedia, because I thought that there would be a lot less contributors than the English one, and more things to contribute to. However, after browsing for a bit, I found that the English Wikipedia page of my hometown, [Medan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medan), was poorly worded and had a few grammatical errors. I fixed some of them in the _Media, Publication, Healthcare and Education_ sections. In the _Education_ section, I also changed outdated information regarding my old middle school. I marked my changes as 'minor edits'. I also noticed that the 'talk' section of the page wasn't very active, but from the revision history page, it seems that it has been edited and updated regularly.  

After that, I went to smaller pages that were also related to my hometown. I fixed grammatical errors in these pages:  
- My hometown's airport, [Kualanamu International Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kualanamu_International_Airport)
- My hometown's specialty dessert, [Bika Ambon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bika_Ambon)

Questions for Danna Kelmer
--------------------------

1. How does Google decide which projects to open-source or not? How does the process work, from starting a project from scratch, developing it, deciding to open source it, and the aftermath? 

2. Are there projects that were meant to be open-sourced by Google but then it was decided otherwise? Why did it happen?  

3. Besides working on Google open source projects, are you also contributing on non-Google open source projects? Do you have favourites?

This week, I noticed that on the Open Definition website that we discussed in class, in the "The Open Definition In Your Language" section, all languages are written in their own language except for "Indonesian", which is an English word. I thought that replacing it with "Bahasa Indonesia" would be more appropriate, so I reported it as an issue on the website's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/okfn/opendefinition). I was pleasantly surprised as it was addressed by the main contributor, Mike Linksvayer, who immediately [added and merged the commit](https://github.com/okfn/opendefinition/pull/180) within 10 minutes of me commenting.

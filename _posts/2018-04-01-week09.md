|1|OpenDefinition|Reported issue [#179](https://github.com/okfn/opendefinition/issues/179)|

This week, I noticed that on the Open Definition website that we discussed in class, in the "The Open Definition In Your Language" section, all languages are written in their own language except for "Indonesian", which is an English word. I thought that replacing it with "Bahasa Indonesia" would be more appropriate, so I reported it as an issue on the website's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/okfn/opendefinition). I was pleasantly surprised as it was addressed by the main contributor, Mike Linksvayer, who immediately [added and merged the commit](https://github.com/okfn/opendefinition/pull/180) within 10 minutes of me commenting.

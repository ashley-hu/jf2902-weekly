2. Forked original repository to personal account

	* git remote add myfork <https://github.com/jfushada/cs480_s18.git>
4. Checked status of remote handle
	* git status -v
	* Result:
		* myfork  <https://github.com/jfushada/cs480_s18> (fetch)
		* myfork  <https://github.com/jfushada/cs480_s18> (push)
		* origin  <https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18.git> (fetch)
		* origin  <https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18.git> (push)
5. Located and fixed error that caused Class 1 to be repeated twice instead of showing Class 2
	* The daily entry for class 2 exists in the repository, in the folder [cs_480_s18/includes/daily](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/blob/gh-pages/_includes/daily/02.markdown)
	* However, in the [daily.html](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/blob/gh-pages/daily.html) page, line 5 has post "01", a repeat of line 4, instead of "02", which is the error that causes the details of Class 2 not to show up on the class site
	* Changed "01" to "02" in Sublime Text
6. Added edited file

7. commited file with message

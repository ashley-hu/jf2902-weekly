[Issue](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/issues/7)  
[Pull Request](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/pull/52)  

Steps to complete the fix:  
1. Cloned the repository  
	* git clone <https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18.git>  
2. Forked original repository to personal account
	* clicked on Fork button in <https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18>
3. Added my own fork address as the remote for my local repository
	* git remote add myfork <https://github.com/jfushada/cs480_s18.git>
4. Checked status of remote handle
	* git status -v
	* Result:
		* myfork  <https://github.com/jfushada/cs480_s18> (fetch)
		* myfork  <https://github.com/jfushada/cs480_s18> (push)
		* origin  <https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18.git> (fetch)
		* origin  <https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18.git> (push)
5. Located and fixed error that caused Class 1 to be repeated twice instead of showing Class 2
	* The daily entry for class 2 exists in the repository, in the folder [cs_480_s18/includes/daily](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/blob/gh-pages/_includes/daily/02.markdown)
	* However, in the [daily.html](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/blob/gh-pages/daily.html) page, line 5 has post "01", a repeat of line 4, instead of "02", which is the error that causes the details of Class 2 not to show up on the class site
	* Changed "01" to "02" in Sublime Text
6. Added edited file
	* git add daily.html
7. commited file with message
	* git commit -m "fixed issue #7, changed daily.html so that class 2 is now shown"
	* note: changed commit message to add detail, with git commit --amend -m "updated message"
8. pushed change to my own fork
	* git push myfork
9. issued pull request
	1. Followed [GitHub tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)
	2. Clicked on New pull request button in <https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18>
	3. On [Compare changes page](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/compare), clicked on compare across forks button

CodeTriage
----------

After signing up, I decided to filter the list by Java, the language I was most comfortable with. Seeing that Elasticsearch and Go Continuous Delivery were the two projects that were labeled in red (with the most issues), I decided to select these projects.  

I then received emails from CodeTriage and examined these issues:
1. Elastic Search [Issue #23533](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/23533): Inconsistent date math support for reindexing api (source.index vs. dest.index)  
	I noticed that this issue didn't have comments other than the original poster's. However, another user re-labeled the post 5 days ago despite it being posted a year ago, which means that there are more people looking at this issue, despite not commenting.  

	The issue was talking about inconsistencies in the reindex from the remote api, but I found it very difficult to find it in the repository, because the poster didn't link to it and the repository was complicated. I found a file called index.json in the api folder, but couldn't find the bug he was looking for. However, I am not familiar with this project, so it could be somewhere that I overlooked. I wasn't too sure on what to do so I left without taking action.

2. Elastic Search [Issue #12431](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12431): Shard awareness leaves replica shards unassigned when racks are unevenly sized  
	This issue had more activity than the first one, with 7 participants and one person assigned to it. The original poster was more thorough than the previous one, giving more information and a direct link to the file. However, the topic was way out of my area of knowledge and I didn't quite understand what the poster was talking about. It seemed like there was a lot of conversation on it, some of which are the main contributors, so I decided to take no action.
	
3. GoCD [Issue #56](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/56): [VSM] View pipeline status in Mini-map  
	This issue was like the first one, with only one poster and no comments, other than two other users modifying labels. However, this one wasn't talking about a bug, but a suggestion of a feature to add to the project. It didn't have any code suggestions, and seemed to be labeled correctly, so I left it as it was.


4. GoCD[Issue #3638](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3638): Agents should log the fact that they're alive and idle every few minutes.  
	This issue was the same as issue number 3, except for the topic, and the fact that it wasn't labeled. However, since it wasn't a bug report that I could try to reproduce, I didn't have anything to add to it.

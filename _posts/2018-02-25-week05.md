Questions
---------

##### 1. What type of things are you looking for when you select an open source project to work on?  

Preferably, I'd like to be working on projects that I use, because it'd be easier to familiarize myself with how the code works. I would also be looking at a high frequency of pull requests and commits by more than just one person. I think that it'd be good to have a large, active community that is welcoming to newcomers. One of the most important things would be looking at the issues themselves, whether they are way too difficult, as well as if issues are being closed regularly, or if the discussions are helpful and lively.  

##### 2. What are you able to offer to the team that you will be working on for the project? (what are your strengths)  

I'm capable of contributing non-code aspects of projects, such as contributing to documentation or fixing grammatical errors. I'm confident that I can also contribute fairly simple coding issues in Java or C. I can also attempt to reproduce/confirm bugs that have been reported, as well as maybe find bugs to report myself. 

##### 3. What are you hoping to learn from working on an open source project?  

I'm hoping to learn how to work with teams in a larger scale, and more specifically the process of communicating with others over an issue or over a pull request, especially someone who is integral to the project. I'm looking forward to experiencing the real world, social aspect of contributing to open source projects, more than the technical aspect.

##### 4. what are you most worried about when you are thinking about and planning to work on an open source project?   

I'm most worried that I would not be able to contribute anything to substantial to any projects. Besides that, I'm also worried about having an unwelcome experience communicating with the open source community.

NYC Open Data Week
------------------

##### [NYC Open Data Week @ NYU](http://www.open-data.nyc/#details75)  

I went to the Open Data event hosted by NYU's own BUGS Open Source Club on Monday, March 5th. The panel was an introduction to Open Data in New York City and each of the panelists had their own fields. Mr. Dominic Mauro was talking from a law perspective, while Ms. Vicky Steeves was from a research perspective and Ms. Dinorah Cantu-Pedraza from a city/collaboration point of view.   

I found the law aspect particularly interesting because I never thought about it from that point of view before. Mr. Mauro stated that it is very important to have laws to mandate open data, but just because laws exist it doesn't mean that everyone follows it, and that transparency is easy when you legislate it for other people.   

Another aspect that was discussed was the horror stories of open data. I've always thought of open data as a 100% good thing, so this was an eye-opener. Examples that were discussed include finding out where military bases are by looking at patterns, and finding information on taxi drivers. Data can be used for a lot of good, but the other side is also highly possible.   

I thought that the panel was very well organized, but I did hope that they would've left more time for questions, because there were very interesting questions that popped up, especially the one who asked about the reliability, verifiability and accountability of the open data itself and how do we know that data provided by the government is not tampered with. I also appreciated that the panelists offered different websites that offered open data, but a written list maybe would've been more useful.  

##### [Data Through Design: Art Exhibit](http://www.open-data.nyc/#details258)  

I went to the Data Through Design art exhibit on Friday, March 9th, in the afternoon with a few friends, and it was empty save for a few other people. It showcases works based on open data in New York City in different, creative ways. There were 8 art pieces in total, and covered different topics, from causes of death to tree topography.   

The one I found most intriguing was "Broken Windows and Pink Tickets", partly because it was the biggest and most colourful/eye-catching display in the room. It was a collection of parachute cords in many different colours hanging down from a rafter of some sort, each representing the number of summons issued for a criminal violation in New York City.   

I liked that the exhibits were interactive in some way, and encouraged the audience to touch and experiment with the objects in their own way, to their own interpretation. I also liked that the exhibits showed data in a very new, artistic way rather than the tables and graphs that we're all used to.  

I was disappointed that the exhibit was so small - I was expecting more art pieces. Also. when we went there, one of them was no longer working. A clearer explanation of the art pieces could also been more helpful, but I understand the desire for the audience to make their own interpretations.  

I emailed my photos to Professor Klukowska.

Team Assessment and Plan
------------------------

##### 1. Based on the team, what are the strenghts and weaknesses of the team in terms of being able to participate in the project you selected? (Use your team-mates' blog posts to assess their strengths and weaknesses)  

Team Django: Jessica Fushada, Kelly Hogan, Rohit Motwani, Shiyang Wang, Kenneth Yang  

Strengths:
- Most of us have had experience with Django before, so it would be easier to familiarise ourselves with the code.
- Django is written in Python, and we all have Python experience. 
- Django's code is hosted on GitHub, and we are proficient with git.  
- We are persistent and looking forward to problem solving and overcoming challenges.

Weaknesses:
- We've never collaborated on a larger scale before, so it'll be a joint first experience contributing to a project with a big community.
- We're all worried that our skills will not be sufficient to make a meaningful contribution. We've looked at different projects with issues that have the 'beginners' tag and found them difficult.
- We're worried at the possibility of encountering an unwelcome experience with the community.  

##### 2. Come up with a common meeting time (2 hour block outside of class) to which all team members can commit. Come up with an alternative meeting time (2 hour block outside of class) to which all team members can commit - the second time slot will serve as an alternative for weeks during which the first time slot does not work and as a second meeting time during weeks when you need to be able to spend more time working together.  

Common meeting time:  
Alternative meeting time:  

##### 3. Create a list of milestones that you need to achieve in order to be able to successfully contribute to the project you selected.  
Team Milestones:  

Personal Milestones:

1. (Re-)Familiarise myself with Django - tutorials, documentation, Code of Conduc
2. Sign up for mailing lists and join IRC chat, listen in and contribute to the discussions
3. Download the latest development version of Django
4. Browse and evaluate/triage the "easy pickings" tickets in the bug tracker and choose at least one to tackle
5. Run Django's test suite
6. Write tests, code and documentation for ticket
7. Review, commit and make pull request
8. Wait for and respond to feedback

##### 4. Setup Team Repositories

- Create a team repository with the fork of the project that your team selected: [Link]()  

- Create another team repository that will be used for coordinating work on the project (use the project board to set up your milestones): [Link]()

This week, I had a lot of fun adding restaurants and other landmarks in my hometown in Indonesia, Medan. I was pleasantly surprised at how detailed OpenStreetMaps was, but there were still many places that weren't on the map, especially some of my favourite hole-in-the-wall restaurants that make Medan the culinary center of Indonesia. In order to make sure that my contributions were correct, I used my own memory, cross-checked with Google Maps (or my bookmarks on Google Maps), and asked my parents for confirmation. I found this a very rewarding experience and will definitely come back to contribute in my own time.

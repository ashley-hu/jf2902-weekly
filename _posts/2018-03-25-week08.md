Humanitarian Open Source Projects
---------------------------------

##### According to the Merrian Webster dictionary, the definition of the word humanitarian (adj) is "relating to or characteristic of people who work to improve the lives and living conditions of other people". Consider the open source projects that you are familiar with (not necessarily the one that you are working on in this class). Could any of them be classified as humanitarian or having humanitarian aspects? Explain.  


For some of my small contributions, I added some landmarks in my hometown on OpenStreetMaps, which familiarized me with the project. I think that it can definitely be classified as humanitarian, because it is a freely accessible and distributable map of the whole world (if you have internet access). It is released with an open-content license, which means that everyone can have access to the map images and all the underlying data.  

After looking into it, I found that OpenStreetMaps has a humanitarian team, HOT (Humanitarian OpenStreetMaps Team). They create and share free, up-to-date maps when major disasters or crises occur around the world, because they are needed especially in the less developed world. In addition to helping relief/aid teams organize their work and reach affected areas, these volunteer maps also help to anticipate and protect against future potential disasters. Therefore, OpenStreetMaps definitely helps improve lives and living conditions of other people, and can be classified as humanitarian.
